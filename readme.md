# BLE remote from a browser (laptop or phone)

Inspired by the project [https://loginov.rocks/Web-Bluetooth-Terminal/](https://loginov.rocks/Web-Bluetooth-Terminal/) that is described in detail [on github](https://gist.github.com/loginov-rocks) and [medium](https://medium.com/@loginov_rocks/how-to-make-a-web-app-for-your-own-bluetooth-low-energy-device-arduino-2af8d16fdbe8) this project provides a BLE remote for Arduino robots.

We need to create the buttons, a define plane etc.
